  <h1 class="header-process">After effects</h1>
  <section class="intro">
<br>  I’ve used after effects before during my course at SDE called Digital Media, so I already had some semblance of skill with using its tools before we had classes about it at UCL.

    <br><br>I created a super short 10-second video which turned into a mock-play-of-the-game from Overwatch (A popular shooter-game). Due to the game’s popularity it was surprisingly easy to find characters with a somewhat clear background in good quality. I chose the character Mccree to work with as I had already started forming an idea in my head to have him shoot some dummy-targets.
    <br>The dummy targets, I decided, would be old vaudeville crop-outs, which would help train my usage of masks and transformations.
    <br><br>I created a super rough storyboard to work from:
    <br><img src="images/aestory.jpg" id="infographic-png" alt="storyboard" class="blogPostImage">

    <br><br>From there I started out with finding materials, backgrounds, clips to use and started setting up my scenes.

    <br><br>I created three ‘compositions’ with two being very similar ones, focused on Mccree with a foggy background and some trees and a composition with the targets being shot down.
    <br>In my storyboard I had envisioned having a transition scene where he aims the gun, but sadly I wasn’t able to find any footage I could work with.

    <br><br><img src="images/scenesleftbehind.jpg" id="infographic-png" alt="storyboard" class="blogPostImage">

    <br><br>I think what I had the most trouble with was getting the white background to dissappear without also turning the character ghostly and with weird spots around the corners of the frame.
    <br>Luckily, I managed to fix this issue by simply switching from trying to use key light and instead using color range to remove the background.

    <br>About midway through the process I was getting bored. I wanted this video to be funny or uplifting, something other than just another badly edited potg-rip offs. In the end, of course it is still just a badly edited potg-ripoff, but at least I hope I put a spin on it and if nothing else at least I feel a little more confident about my after effect skills.
    <br>But back to it having to be funny.
    <br>I was looking for ‘pling’ sounds for when Mccree shoots the targets, and stumbled upon a bunch of soundfiles of men yelling “no” or variations thereof which I thought would be funny to put throughout the video.
    <br>As the cherry on top, I put a very old, very low quality video at the very end of the person presumeably yelling ‘no’ (i.e. the person who didnt get potg) smacking their computer.
    <br>Along with the vaudeville cut-outs, I was hoping this would maybe be perceived as an ‘oldtimey’ version of Overwatch or something similar.

    <br><br>This is my final video:
    <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="videos/aerender.mp4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen class="video-grid-small-vid" controls></iframe><br>

<br>I cant honestly say that I am satisfied with my work, and may update this page in the future with a different project that I can more confidently say I'm proud of.<br>
